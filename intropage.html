    <iframe src="http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/embed/ryRUsPSZM"></iframe>
 <p>In the 1990s, violent and property crimes began to drop. But the US's incarceration rate continued to climb.</p>
    <p><b>1 in 5 </b>are locked up for drug offenses. About half of federal prisoners are incarcerated for nonviolent drug crimes.</p>
  <p>According to Brennan Center For Justice, 39 percent of Americans are unnecessarily incarcerated. This means that there is no public safety rationale to keep them behind bars.</p>
    <p>Who are these 2.3 million people? How did they find themselves behind bars?</p>
